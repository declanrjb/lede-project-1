The film explores the inspirations Mizrahi drew from to create the line -- which include Eskimos and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" -- while revealing the harried reality of mounting a major fashion show. Along the way, a number of bold-faced fashion icons and actors crop up, including John Galliano to Richard Gere.",78,78,"Unzipped"
