As Kat and Bastian's inescapable hit single, ""Marry Me,"" climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will streamed across multiple platforms. Divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman, HBO's Big Little Lies) and his best friend (Sarah Silverman).

But as forces conspire to separate them, the universal question arises: Can two people from such different worlds bridge the gulf between them and build a place where they both belong?",61,92,"Marry Me"
