However, when long-gestating aspirations and forgotten passions bubble to the surface, the family's domestic peace is threatened. The father, Carlo (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), is weary of his insurance job and longs to be a writer; his wife, Giulia (Laura Morante), is a literature professor but would rather be an actress. These innocent if secret desires take a turn for the worse when Carlo begins an affair with an old flame (Monica Bellucci).",55,59,"Remember Me, My Love"
