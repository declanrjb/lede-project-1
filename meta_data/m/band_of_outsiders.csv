The misfit trio upends convention at every turn, be it through choreographed dances in caf√©s or frolicsome romps through the Louvre. Eventually, their romantic view of outlaws pushes them to plan their own heist, but their inexperience may send them out in a blaze of glory -- which could be just what they want.",94,91,"Band of Outsiders"
