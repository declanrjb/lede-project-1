He ends up in Bangkok, where isolation and anxiety have pushed him to the brink of suicide. Unexpectedly, he meets free-spirited bar hostess Noi (Sinitta Boonyasak), who is dealing with her sister's recent death. The marijuana-loving Noi is nothing like the perpetually nervous Kenji, yet they form an odd bond over their sadnesses. But Kenji doesn't know the Yakuza have followed him to Bangkok.",90,90,"Last Life in the Universe"
