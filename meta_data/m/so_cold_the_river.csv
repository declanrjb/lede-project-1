Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Erica Shaw (Bethany Joy Lenz, ""Dexter"") is hired by Alyssa Bradford-Cohen (Alysia Reiner, ""Orange is the New Black"") to profile her dying father-in-law, the enigmatic millionaire Campbell Bradford. Erica is presented with a substantial sum of money and a relic, an antique bottle filled with water from a local spring, one of the few clues connecting Bradford to the town he once dominated. While researching Bradford as a guest of a massive, opulent resort with a dark past, Erica meets unofficial town historian Anne McKinney (Tony Award-winner Deanna Dunagan), fanatical intern Kellyn (Katie Sarife, Annabelle Comes Home) and hotel maintenance worker Josiah (Andrew J. West, ""The Walking Dead""), a descendant of Bradford's who reveals the familial curse of mysterious deaths and suicides. Seemingly possessed by the relic, Erica begins drinking from the antique bottle, experiencing terrifying visions and, ultimately, unleashing unspeakable evil. Can Erica make her way through the darkness or is Campbell's evil undercurrent too strong?",58,42,"So Cold the River"
