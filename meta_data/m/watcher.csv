In an almost Hitchcockian way, the film quickly introduces us to the killer, David Allen Griffin, played by Keanu Reeves, who for many years, preyed on lonely young women in the Los Angeles area. The story is set up to create a taut cat-and-mouse game between Griffin and FBI agent Joel Campbell.",11,28,"The Watcher"
