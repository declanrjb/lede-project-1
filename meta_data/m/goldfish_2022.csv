About retaining humanity in the face of the inevitable. It's all about love, dementia, identity, and diaspora. As the script began to evolve, it became about the collision of two unreliable memories. And then the cast got involved. And the film became one about community and the definition of family. When the music emerged from the collision of the lyrics and two cultures, it began to shape the palette of the piece. With help from a neighborhood and a past she has shunned, a young woman returns home to deal with her mother's dementia and the scars of her childhood.",93,NA,"Goldfish"
