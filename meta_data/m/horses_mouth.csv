A swindler in search of his next art project, he hunkers down in the penthouse of would-be patrons the Beeders (Robert Coote, Veronica Turleigh) while they go on an extended vacation; he paints a mural on their wall, pawns their valuables and, along with the sculptor Abel (Richard Gough), inadvertently smashes a large hole in their floor.
