Easier said than done, apparently, as a number of small-scale crises keep things from going smoothly, even with the help of an extravagant priest and a how-to video cassette. Tensions rise and boundaries are pushed in this satire about the clash between modern convenience and traditional culture.",100,85,"The Funeral"
