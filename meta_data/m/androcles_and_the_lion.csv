A devoted Christian with an unparalleled level of compassion, he seeks to aid any who need assistance -- even a wild lion with a thorn in its paw. While the move to remove the thorn may seem foolhardy, Androcles' kindness is later repaid in the blood-stained ring of the Colosseum.",43,48,"Androcles and the Lion"
