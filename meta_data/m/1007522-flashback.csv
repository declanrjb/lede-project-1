Finally apprehended, Walker is escorted to trial by uptight 20-something FBI agent John Buckner (Kiefer Sutherland). While the two seem to be polar opposites, it turns out that Buckner may have more in common with Walker than is initially apparent, a point that is driven home when the pair faces off against a sinister small-town sheriff (Cliff De Young).",40,59,"Flashback"
