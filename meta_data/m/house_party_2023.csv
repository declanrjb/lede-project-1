Out of money, down on their luck and about to lose the roofs over their heads--and freshly fired from their low-lift jobs as house cleaners--the pair needs a huge windfall to make their problems go away. In a 'what the hell?' move, they decide to host the party of the year at an exclusive mansion, the site of their last cleaning job, which just happens to belong to none other than LeBron James. No permission? No problem. What could go wrong? How about a time traveling DJ, undependable security, a runaway guest list, one borrowed Lamborghini, angry rival promoters, a stolen championship ring, escalating property damage, an angry koala..? But also, one outrageous ride stacked with double-take cameos and timeless throwback tracks, R-rated comedy and two friends worth cheering for... you have to see to believe. After all, a night like this doesn't come around more than once.",28,60,"House Party"
