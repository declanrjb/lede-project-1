In addition to featuring many musical numbers, the film presents scenes both hilarious and heartbreaking. Among the many stars included are Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo and the Marx Brothers, though arguably nothing is as showstopping as the exclusive dance routines performed by Kelly and Astaire together.",71,78,"That's Entertainment, Part 2"
