He is being tested for his mental and physical ability to adapt to extreme cold, isolation and homesickness; vital qualities in mankind's proposed colonization of the 'final frontiers' on earth and beyond. Creature is an unearthly tale of exploitation and human frontiers inspired by Georg BÃ¼chner's expressionist classic Woyzeck, with shadows of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Drawing on themes of abandonment, isolation and the fragility of the mind, Creature is the tale of an outsider and the search for belonging.",90,80,"Creature"
