Weiss","Universal/Universal Int","R","Comedy","English","Jun 1, 2004","$388.2K","1h 25m","In this film of unconnected humor sketches, bad movies and late-night television are parodied extensively. A doctor (Griffin Dunne) has to help Brenda (Michelle Pfeiffer) give birth, with unexpected results. In ""Son of the Invisible Man,"" Griffin (Ed Begley Jr.) is actually more naked than invisible. Among the many other segments, there is a spoof of alarmist 1950s hygiene instructional films featuring a woman (Carrie Fisher) being harshly advised about her new sexually transmitted disease.",65,58,"Amazon Women on the Moon"
