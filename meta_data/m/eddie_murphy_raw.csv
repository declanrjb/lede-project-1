Eddie's uncle (Samuel L. Jackson) and other family members are lampooned in sketch segments, while Murphy largely sticks to stand-up, riffing on fellow black comedians, marriage and various racial and ethnic stereotypes, among many other topics. The concert is particularly renowned for Murphy's liberal and unrepentant use of expletives.",78,85,"Eddie Murphy Raw"
