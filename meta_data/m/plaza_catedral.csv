Her six year old son died in an accident she feels she could have avoided. Her grief is plagued by guilt, which has made her disassociate from society, from married life, and from herself. She now lives in the old quarter of Panama, a rich colonial enclave surrounded by Panamá poorest neighborhoods. There she meets Chief, a street-smart 13 year old who takes care of cars in front of her apartment and insists on getting paid for his job. Alicia keeps a safe distance from him, until one night Chief arrives at Alicia's apartment bleeding from a gunshot wound, and begs her for help. Reluctantly, Alicia lets him in. What she could not imagine is that by opening the door to Chief, she would open the door to an unforeseen emotional bond. Caring for Chief makes her feel connected to life again, and it hurts.",89,NA,"Plaza Catedral"
