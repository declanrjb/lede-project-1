Outside it's monsoon season, but Ling's inner turmoil looks set to get her into a heap of trouble. Director Anthony Chen brings this simmering Singapore-set drama to boiling point, whilst using an associative and poetic editing rhythm, repeating colors and shapes to highlight the small parallels that link people, and reveal the profound in lovely and subtle ways. With uniformly sensitive performances from the returning cast of Ilo Ilo, Chen's Wet Season is the classy and well-measured teacher-student drama that will get you weeping this autumn.",82,56,"Wet Season"
