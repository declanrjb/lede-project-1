Proudly without plot, this feature follows band members Peter Tork, Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith on a trippy adventure through 1960s Hollywood, Calif., where they cross paths with such people as Dennis Hopper, Frank Zappa and Jack Nicholson. In a variety of vignettes and musical performances, the daffy antics of the band are on full display.",71,71,"Head"
