        </div>
        <p>It was November 2021, and Chloé Zhao was facing disappointment. The Academy Award Winning director had garnered widespread
            excitement for her latest film: Marvel Studios' <i>The Eternals</i>. Yet the movie underperformed dramatically at the
            box office, earning only about 160 million USD — <a href='https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchise/fr541495045/'>the second lowest</a> of any Marvel film to date, and <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinereid/2023/02/13/eternals-was-over-budget-says-marvel/'>not enough to make back its budget</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Zhao's case was not unique. Since 1980, films directed by women have earned significantly less at the box office than
            films directed by men, a divide that has only steepened in recent years, according to more than 10,000 film records scraped
            from the rankings site Rotten Tomatoes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <figure class="figure-chart">

        <p>Yet this is only half the story. A director may guide the artistic vision of a film, but its stars are the face of the project. 
            Since Rotten Tomatoes does not list whether a film is primarily about men or women, we'll need 
        to take a closer look at the film's descriptions to approximate that gender divide. Consider these synopses for <i>The Bourne Identity</i> (2002) and <i>The Hunger Games</i> (2012).
        Both descriptions provide subtle cues we can use to approximate the gender data we need.</p>

        <p>Not all synopses so clearly categorize themselves as 'the story of a man', nor do all include the main character's first name. 
            But most do include a pronoun — 'her life' or 'his story' — and usually the first pronoun mentioned will refer to the 
        film's primary lead, if one exists. By extracting those first pronouns from each synopsis, we can compare the profitability
        of films about both men and women.</p>

        <p>By contrast, female directors – their work already underearning – face an additional loss of only about 2 million dollars
            for projects starring women. That such a significant profit gap exists even for male directors suggests that the gender of
            a film's protagonist has a significant effect on its profitability, regardless of the creative team behind the project.
        </p>
        <p>Yet ultimately the most significant profit gap remains for a film's director. For films starring men – the most profitable
            category – female directors can expect to earn an average of 20 million dollars less than their male colleagues.

        <p>That profit gap can have real economic consquences. Of the 778 films in the dataset released since 2020, only 
            about a third described women in their synposes, and only one in five were directed by women. Without more enthusiasm
        from audiences, such films may find it difficult to get off the ground.</p>

            <p>RottenTomatoes.com is a movie rankings site which stores individual films under unique URLs. Each film page contains
                information about the film, including critical (Critics %) and popular (Audience %) reviews, a synposis,
                the film's U.S. gross in USD, and a list of five related films.
            </p>
            <p>A spider scraper was fed an initial list of 300 seed urls taken from Rotten Tomatoes <a href='https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-movies-of-all-time/'>editorial list of the best
                movies of all time</a>. Upon visiting each page, the scraper saved relevant information about a film
                to a local disk. It then collected the URLs of that page's five 'related' films and added them to the bottom
                of the stack for further scraping. After each iteration, the stack was refined to remove URLs that had already
                been visited.
            </p>
            <p>This method produced a 'spiderweb' growth pattern that organically visited thousands of films reachable from the 
                initial set before eventually converging when the remaining stack reached 0. While this method did not guarantee
                an even pass over all Rotten Tomatoes pages, it provided a large sample of films within the general breadth of culturally 
                relevant films.
            </p>
            <p>Data analysis was performed in R, with directors' first names converted to genders using the SSA method. The original
                10,723 records were reduced to 10,213 rows with usable data.
