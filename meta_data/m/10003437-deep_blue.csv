Gray whales make their migratory journeys despite being menaced by killer whiles, while smaller fish struggle to stay alive. In the Arctic, penguins and polar bears endure the winter, while on beaches crabs emerge to feed. Meanwhile, five miles under the water, unusual forms of life thrive -- many of them in places less explored than the moon.",69,80,"Deep Blue"
