Featuring scenic shots of seaside cliffs and rocky expanses, the film, which takes a few fictional liberties, shows islanders fishing and farming in inventive ways in order to keep food on their tables. While some dramatic moments reveal a sense of narrative, the main draw of the production is the stunning scenery.",92,75,"Man of Aran"
