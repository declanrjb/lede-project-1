Specializing in investigative journalism, over the years he has made many enemies in Dublin's criminal underworld. In search of peace and quiet, he and his wife Siobhan take their baby son Oisín to their holiday home on a remote island off the north-west coast of Ireland. There they keep to themselves, avoiding interaction with the islanders. Early one morning, Tomás receives an urgent call from work and must return to the mainland, leaving Siobhan and Oisín on the island. Later that day he returns to find that they are both missing and, in desperation, seeks the help of the island's retired policewoman, Labhaoise. With warnings of an approaching storm, Labhaoise organizes a search party of islanders. The next morning they make a grisly discovery -- but it is not what they expected. Meanwhile, the storm is getting ever-closer to the island.",60,NA,"Doineann"
