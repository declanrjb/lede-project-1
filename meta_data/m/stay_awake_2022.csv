Their mother, played by Metz, is loving and well-meaning but powerless to pull herself out of the destructive cycle of her disease. The boys must put their dreams on the backburner as they're constantly discovering their mom passed out, dragging her to the hospital, and encouraging to go to rehab--with the possibility of relapse always lingering. Anchored by three superb performances, STAY AWAKE finds surprising humor and humanity amid the tragedy of parental addiction.",88,85,"Stay Awake"
