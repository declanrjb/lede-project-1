With mere weeks before impact and the world on the brink of annihilation, NASA executive and former astronaut Jo Fowler (Academy AwardÂ® winner Halle Berry) is convinced she has the key to saving us all -- but only one astronaut from her past, Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson, ""Midway"") and a conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman (John Bradley, ""Game of Thrones"") believe her. These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is.",35,70,"Moonfall"
