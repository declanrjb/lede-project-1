Simmons), Jackie only pisses him off. Fleeing the scene, Jackie takes bored waitress Lola as a hostage. When Jackie reveals he needs money to get his son out of jail, Lola cooks up a scheme for them to get cash from her dying mother (Virginia Madsen). Meanwhile, a thug sent to kill him is sleeping with Jackie's ex. Also starring Frank Grillo, this crime-comedy is a witty homage to Tarantino and the Coen brothers.",64,49,"One Day as a Lion"
