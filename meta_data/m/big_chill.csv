Having entered adulthood as non-conformists, most now belong to the establishment. Harold (Kevin Kline) has ""grown up"" to be a running-shoe magnate; Michael (Jeff Goldblum), a gossip magazine journalist; Sam (Tom Berenger), TV's hottest private eye; and Nick (William Hurt), a drug dealer. Among the women, Sarah (Glenn Close) is a doctor; Meg (Mary Kay Place), a lawyer; and Karen (JoBeth Williams), a wife and mother in the suburbs. Stunned by the death of their peer, sensing their own mortality and the loss of their innocence, each takes the opportunity to reevaluate his or her life and re-establish their bond.",69,77,"The Big Chill"
