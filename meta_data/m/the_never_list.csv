Running for student

class president while juggling a heavy academic schedule and planning the upcoming

school dance, Eva dreams of becoming a comic book artist – something she knows her

helicopter mom would never support. Since elementary school, Eva and her BFF Liz

(Brenna D’Amico) have cosplayed their alter-egos, “Vicky” and “Veronica,” as a way to

release the pressure they feel. Together, they imagine Vicky and Veronica doing highly

questionable, even illegal, acts that the real Eva and Liz would never do... acts they

document in “The Never List.” When Liz dies in a tragic accident, Eva is filled with anger

and regret thinking about all the things Liz never did out of fear of risking her future…

a future she ultimately would never have. Eva decides the best way to honor her best

friend’s memory is to complete The Never List. At first this journey leads her to

romance and adventure, but as the list progresses, her actions begin threatening the

very foundations of her carefully planned teenage life and even her own future.",60,100,"The Never List"
