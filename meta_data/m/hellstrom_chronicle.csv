With their collective intelligence, high capacity for work and sharp instincts, the film argues, they are waging a struggle against humans for supremacy of our planet. Expert cinematography captures footage of the small creatures, some quite tiny and elusive, interspersed with clips from horror films to achieve dramatic effects.",75,87,"The Hellstrom Chronicle"
