All the while living in poverty, witnessing social injustice while dealing with his conservative, cable-news-consuming, and opioid-addicted next-door neighbor, Meryl. Knowing very little English and far from the ideal new American life he imagined. Jacir embarks on a journey to win the affection of a new love interest, Nadia, while dealing with her overzealous dad Adam; and measuring a newfound friendship with an African American line cook and rapper named Jerome. JACIR shows us the importance of letting go of our preconceived notions of one another, being there for our community, and fixing what is broken no matter what our pain may do to us.",100,100,"Jacir"
