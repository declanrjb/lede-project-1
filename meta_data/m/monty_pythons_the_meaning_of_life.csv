The seven parts of life cover birth, growing up, war, middle age, organ transplants, old age and death. Not all stages are singular: ""Part I: The Miracle of Birth"" is from the perspective of an ignored woman in labor, and of a Roman Catholic couple with too many children, and ""Part VII: Death"" encompasses a funeral and heaven.
