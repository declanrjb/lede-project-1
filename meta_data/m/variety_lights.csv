At a small town engagement, he encounters the starry-eyed, gorgeous Lily Antonelli (Carla Del Poggio), and hires her as a dancer on the show. Vivacious Lily quickly sells out crowds and earns the resentment of Checco's mistress, Melina Amour (Giulietta Masina), but the fledgling performer has far bigger ambitions and soon sets her sights on a higher-profile role.",100,71,"Variety Lights"
