Her mother, on the other hand, thinks that her oldest daughter is about to miss a lifetime of happiness if she doesn't take her focus away from her new startup job and place it on finding a husband instead. Taking matters into her own hands, Asha's mother creates an online dating profile in order to set Asha up with a ""perfect"" match. Enter Ravi (Suraj Sharma) -- or rather Ravi's parents -- who have the exact same idea for their son. Asha and Ravi's reluctant first date is a bust, and they quickly discover that each is in a seemingly different place in their life right now. After realizing her mother is relentless and will not give up, Asha proposes a plan to Ravi that would be a win-win for both: a pretend relationship to be each other's date to get through the upcoming wedding season. Through countless invitations, dances and dresses in the next three months, Asha and Ravi slowly come to find that they might have more in common than they think. Maybe their parents were onto something after all.",88,66,"Wedding Season"
